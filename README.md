# Open Standards-Based Development for Discovery & Interoperability

This repository contains materials for my (Tiffany Chan's) presentation at Open Repositories 2023, titled *Open Standards-Based Development for Discovery & Interoperability*. The [conference program](https://www.conftool.net/or2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&presentations=show&form_tracks=&form_date=2023-06-15) is available online.

Here is the presentation abstract:
>The University of Victoria Libraries recently finished its migration from ContentDNto Samvera’s open-source platform, Hyku. Developers at the Libraries have built several custom features to support Linked Data integration and make library collections more discoverable and useable. These features include linked data authorities, automatic indexing of EDTF (Extended Datetime Format)-compliant dates, collection discovery tools, and audio/video viewer with interactive transcripts. I will provide an overview/tour of these features in Vault (vault.library.uvic.ca), our local, customized instance of Hyku. Vault’s open-source code is also on Github (github.com/UVicLibrary/Vault).
